<a href= "https://sean-mongey.github.io/Pacmen/">Pacmen</a>

<!-----Summary-------->
This pacman factory can create multiple pacmen and send them bouncing around the screen.
<!-----How to use-------->
Click the "Pacman Factory" button to make a Pacman. Continue clicking this button to create an army of Pacmen
Click the "Start Game" button to start the Pacmen bouncing around the screen.

<!-------Future Improvements-------->
I would like to build different shaped containers to effect where the Pacmen bounce. 
Create an additional button to remove Pacmen, potentially in a graphic manner.
